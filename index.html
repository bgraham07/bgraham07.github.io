      </h2>
      <p>Being able to complete my Computer Science program at SHNU has been a wonderful experience, it’s taught me so much about technical skills and to have a professional outlook. My development in this ePortfolio has given me a great opportunity to reflect on my personal growth and allowed me to demonstrate my skills to enter the field.</p>
      <p>I have learned a ton from this journey and built a solid foundation in software engineering, algorithms, databases, and security. I have become comfortable with working and building a full-stack application but also took going in with a security first mindset to ensure it has a solid architecture.</p>
      <p>From personal experiences with collaborating in a team environment as a Product Owner, I have learned that it’s critical for growth. This program has helped me balance ownership of tasks with communication and taught me version control with projects. When it comes to clear communication with technical and non-technical stakeholders it has become second nature.</p>
      <p>I have learned algorithms and data structures on optimizing trip filtering and sorting in my Tralvr app. By implementing good back-end logic using JavaSCript I was able to refactor the query strategies and indexing in MongoDB which shows how algorithmic thinking can translate into a real work problem.</p>
      <p>When it comes to software engineering and my database knowledge, I had a ton of hands on experience with MEAN stack apps, applying authentication, and deploying full applications. My enhancements were security focused and applied to the database security and converting server-side components to SPAs.</p>
      <p>Throughout this project security was a top priority and I added input validations with Joi, secured API routes with passport.js and JWTs, and implemented rate limiting for sensitive operations.</p>
      <p>I made my decision on which artifacts to enhancement based off a real world application and began with a basic, functioning system to show how I slowly improved it in terms of authentication, performance and security.</p>
      <p>I believe this ePortfolio will tell the whole story of what I have built along with how I’ve grown as a developer and problem solver. I’m excited to take the skills I’ve learned and apply them to my role and continue to learn.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>This module focuses on enhancing the security of my application and refactoring the architecture to follow best practices. The updated code is hosted in a separate branch of my GitHub repository.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GitHub Branch:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bgraham07/CS499-Capstone/tree/module3-refactor" target="_blank">module3-refactor</a></li>
        <li><strong>Key Enhancements:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Frontend login moved from Handlebars to Angular SPA</li>
            <li>Backend JWT-based authentication middleware added</li>
            <li>All code commented and documented for clarity</li>
                    <li><strong>Narrative:</strong>
          <p>This enhancement focused on implementing full authentication in my Travlr Gateways full stack app using passport.js. It included hashed password validation, secure session handling, and route protection via express-jwt. This process emphasized the importance of secure backend design and demonstrated my ability to manage sessions securely. I initially only implemented this on Handlebars and not Angular SPA, which I later identified as a gap to improve on.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>For this module, I continued enhancing the Travlr app with a focus on optimizing how trip data is filtered and sorted, both on the frontend and backend. This work aligns with the course outcomes related to designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithms.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GitHub Branch:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bgraham07/CS499-Capstone/tree/module4-refactor" target="_blank">module4-refactor</a></li>
        <li><strong>Key Enhancements:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Refactored backend logic for dynamic trip filtering and sorting</li>
            <li>Integrated optimized queries and data structures to improve response speed</li>
            <li>Implemented frontend filtering/sorting for both admin (port 4200) and public travel site (port 3000)</li>
            <li>Resolved challenges restructuring backend without breaking frontend compatibility</li>
                    <li><strong>Narrative:</strong>
          <p>For this enhancement, I focused on filtering and sorting trip data in the Travlr app. I implemented and optimized this functionality on both the frontend and backend across two views (admin and public). This enhancement demonstrated my understanding of algorithmic efficiency and improved the app's performance and user experience. A significant challenge was restructuring the backend without breaking the frontend, which required careful planning and problem-solving.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>This module covers the deployment process and setting up continuous integration pipelines to automate testing and deployment. It ensures the application is reliably updated and maintained.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GitHub Branch:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bgraham07/CS499-Capstone/tree/module5-refactor" target="_blank">module5-refactor</a></li>
        <li><strong>Key Enhancements:</strong>
          <ul>

            <li>Improved data handling across both admin and public-facing views</li>
            <li>Implemented rate limiting for DB read/write operations</li>
            <li>Secured MongoDB connection settings and pool configuration</li>
            <li>Applied Joi-based validation for inputs and ObjectIds</li>
            <li>Hardened error handling for duplicate keys, cast errors, and validation failures</li>
            <li>Sanitized queries to prevent NoSQL injection attacks</li>
                    <li><strong>Narrative:</strong>
          <p>In this module, I worked on enhancing database security and reliability in my full stack app. I implemented rate limiting using a custom rateLimiter.js, optimized MongoDB connection handling in db.js, and enforced timeouts. Additionally, I introduced Joi validation, robust error handling, and query sanitization to defend against NoSQL injection. This helped me treat the project as a real-world system requiring secure and scalable practices.</p>
